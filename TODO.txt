Opciones interesantes de curl para introducir con el tiempo (ver man curl)...

# -D, --dump-header <filename>
#              (HTTP FTP) Write the received protocol headers to the specified file.
#
#              This  option  is  handy to use when you want to store the headers that an HTTP site sends to you. Cookies from the headers could then be read in a second curl invocation by using the -b, --cookie option! The -c, --cookie-jar option is a better way to
#              store cookies.
#See also -o, --output.

#See also the --create-dirs option to create the local directories dynamically. Specifying the output as '-' (a single dash) will force the output to be done to stdout.

# -O, --remote-name
#              Write output to a local file named like the remote file we get. (Only the file part of the remote file is used, the path is cut off.)
#
#              The file will be saved in the current working directory. If you want the file saved in a different directory, make sure you change the current working directory before invoking curl with this option.
#
#              The  remote  file  name to use for saving is extracted from the given URL, nothing else, and if it already exists it will be overwritten. If you want the server to be able to choose the file name refer to -J, --remote-header-name which can be used in
#              addition to this option. If the server chooses a file name and that name already exists it will not be overwritten.
#
#              There is no URL decoding done on the file name. If it has %20 or other URL encoded parts of the name, they will end up as-is as file name.
#
#              You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you have.
#


#--keepalive-time <seconds>
#              This  option  sets  the time a connection needs to remain idle before sending keepalive probes and the time between individual keepalive probes. It is currently effective on operating systems offering the TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL socket options
#              (meaning Linux, recent AIX, HP-UX and more). This option has no effect if --no-keepalive is used.#
#
#              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. If unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.#
#
#              Added in 7.18.0

#Forzamos el keepalive TCP
#keepalive 

#       --stderr
#              Redirect all writes to stderr to the specified file instead. If the file name is a plain '-', it is instead written to stdout.
#
#              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
#
#              See also -v, --verbose and -s, --silent.
